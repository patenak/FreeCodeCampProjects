## RANDOM QUOTE GENERATOR, V1.0
### README Added post implementation: 16-NOV-2016

Random Quote Generator for Free Code Camp project.  Works, with a minimal amount of quotes.  Quotes are stored as a JSON object in seperate codepen pen: http://codepen.io/patenakev/pen/rrAGXP, and in file: Quotes4Generator_v1_1.js.

Planned Updates:
1. Add more quotes
2. Update styling, its quite ugly.
3. Make it more mobile friendly.
4. and whatever glaring issues there are.
